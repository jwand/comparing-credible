V040101     Study.5. Pre-election post-stratified sample weight
=============================================================================

STUDY DESCRIPTIVE:

Pre-election sample weight

NOTES:
------
This is a 6-digit variable with coded decimal point and
4 actual decimal places.
The 2004 NES weights are post-stratified to 2004 CPS March 
Supplement proportions for six (6) ages by four (4) education 
categories.  The post-stratification adjustment is computed by
dividing the CPS weighted total by the 2004 NES total weighted
by the nonresponse adjusted selection weight. .
The final analysis weight is the product of the household 
level non-response adjustment factor, the number of eligible 
persons, and a person-level post-stratification factor.

Numeric  Dec 4

=============================================================================
V040102     Study.6. Post-election post-stratified sample weight
=============================================================================

STUDY DESCRIPTIVE:

Post-election sample weight

NOTES:
------
This is a 6-digit variable with coded decimal point and
4 actual decimal places.
The 1,066 Post-Election cases were post-stratified to 2004 CPS 
March Supplement proportions for six (6) ages by four (4) 
education categories.  The post-stratification compensates for 
differential non-response by age group and education level.  
The panel attrition weight for the Post-Election Study is the 
product of the Pre-Election final weight and the post-
stratification factor formed by dividing the CPS proportion by 
the weighted NES proportion for each of the 24 age by 
education cells.  The weight is scaled to sum to the number of 
cases, 1066.

Please look at page 2 of the booklet.
I'd like to get your feelings toward some of our political
leaders and other people who are in the news these days. I'll
read the name of a person and I'd like you to rate that
person using something we call the feeling thermometer.
Ratings between 50 degrees and 100 degrees mean
that you feel favorable and warm toward the person.
Ratings between 0 degrees and 50 degrees mean that you
don't feel favorable toward the person and that you
don't care too much for that person. You would
rate the person at the 50 degree mark if you don't feel
particularly warm or cold toward the person.
If we come to a person whose name you don't recognize, you
don't need to rate that person. Just tell me and we'll move on
to the next one.

Please look at page 4 of the booklet.
Some people believe the United States should solve
international problems by using diplomacy and other forms of
international pressure and use military force only if

this scale.
Others believe diplomacy and pressure often fail and the US
must be ready to use military force. Suppose we put them at
number 7.
And of course others fall in positions in-between, at points
2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.

There is much concern about the rapid rise in medical and

Some people feel there should be a government insurance plan

Others feel that all medical expenses should be paid by
individuals through private insurance plans like Blue Cross or
other company paid plans. Suppose these people are at
the other end, at point 7.
And, of course, some other people have opinions somewhere
in between, at points 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.

            N6. INTRO AID TO BLACKS SCALE
=============================================================================

Please look at page 10 of the booklet.
Some people feel that the government in Washington
should make every effort to improve the social and
economic position of blacks. (Suppose these people are
at one end of a scale, at point 1.)  Others feel that
the government should not make any special effort to
help blacks because they should help themselves.
(Suppose these people are at the other end, at point 7.)
And, of course, some other people have opinions
somewhere in between, at points 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.

=============================================================================

Please look at page 11 of the booklet
Some people think it is important to protect the environment
even if it costs some jobs or otherwise reduces our standard
of living.  (Suppose these people are at one end of the
scale, at point number 1)  Other people  think that
protecting the environment is not as important as
maintaining jobs and our standard of living. (Suppose
these people are at the other end of the scale, at point
number 7.  And of course, some other people have
opinions somewhere in between, at points 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6).

(Suppose these people are at one end of a scale, at

home. (Suppose these people are at the other end, at
point 7.) And, of course, some other people have
opinions somewhere in between, at points 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6.

VALID CODES:
------------
1. Someone IN ADDITION TO RESPONDENT is age 14 or older
   in household
5. NO ONE OTHER THAN RESPONDENT is age 14 or older in
   household
8. Coding error by Interviewer; R indicated as married/
   partnered in Y2x, but coded in Y20 for R only person
   age 14+
9. Coding error by Interviewer; person in household
   listing other than R or spouse/partner who is age 14
   or older, but coded for R only person age 14+

NOTES:
------
Coded by interviewer for income questions: households with
more than 1 person earning income are asked both family income
and respondent income.
Some spouses/partners were not in the respondent's household
due to residence in nursing home or due to military service
etc. If R indicated married/partnered in Y2x then 1 is coded
here, even if spouse/partner is not included in household
listing.  Code 8 corresponds to cases where IWR omitted
counting a spouse/partner.
Code 9 corresponds to cases where no spouse/partner is
indicated in Y2x and where household listing (see Y20x)
indicated at least one other person besides R who was aged
14 or older, but interviewer miscoded Y20 to indicate
that R was the only person aged 14 or older. (If however,
all other persons in HH were indicated as roommates, then 1
has been coded; in all cases but 1 of code 9, however, the
other persons in household were identified as family
members). For cases coded 8 or 9, only R's individual income
has been determined (Y21b); total household income
(Y21a/Y21x) was not asked.

In general, House incumbents in this file have been regarded
as candidates (already) in office representing a district,
where district is regarded as a geographic rather than a
political unit, at the time of the 2004 election.  The extent
of the Texas redistricting prior to the 2004 election produced
House races with incumbents running in areas where he or she
had provided little or no prior representation, thus no
Texas candidate has been identified as a true incumbent
(running or retiring) for the new districts.

MISSING CODES:

INAP. no incumbent candidate in 2004 House race; Texas;
District of Columbia; no post IW

NOTES:
------
In general, House incumbents in this file have been regarded
as candidates (already) in office representing a district,
where district is regarded as a geographic rather than a
political unit, at the time of the 2004 election.  The extent
of the Texas redistricting prior to the 2004 election produced
House races with incumbents running in areas where he or she
had provided little or no prior representation, thus no
Texas candidate has been identified as a true incumbent
(running or retiring) for the new districts.

=============================================================================

Please look at page 2 of the booklet.
I'd like to get your feelings toward some of our political
leaders and other people who are in the news these days.

I'll read the name of a person and I'd like you to rate that
person using something we call the feeling thermometer.
Ratings between 50 degrees and 100 degrees mean that you feel
favorable and warm toward the person. Ratings between 0
degrees and 50 degrees mean that you don't feel favorable
toward the person and that you don't care too much for that
person. You would rate the person at the 50 degree mark if you
don't feel particularly warm or cold toward the person.

If we come to a person whose name you don't recognize, you
don't need to rate that person. Just tell me and
we'll move on to the next one.

=============================================================================

Please look at page 6 of the booklet.
Some people believe the United States should solve
international problems by using diplomacy and other forms of
international pressure and use military force only if
absolutely necessary. Suppose these people are at one end of a
scale, at point 1.
Others believe diplomacy and pressure often fail and the U.S.
must be ready to use military force. Suppose these people are
at the other end, at point 7.
And, of course, some other people have opinions somewhere in
between, at points 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.

Please look at page 8 of the booklet.
Some people feel that the government in Washington should make
every effort to improve the social and economic position of
Hispanic-Americans. Suppose these people are at one end of a
scale, at point 1.
Others feel that the government should not make any special
effort to help Hispanic-Americans because they should help
themselves. Suppose these people are at the other end, at
point 7.
And, of course, some other people have opinions somewhere in
between, at points 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.

Please turn to page 11 of the booklet.
Now I have some questions about different groups in our
society. I'm going to show you a seven-point scale on which
the characteristics of the people in a group can be rated.

In the first statement a score of 1 means that you think
almost all of the people in that group tend to be
"hard-working." A score of 7 means that you think most
people in the group are "lazy." A score of 4 means that you
think that most people in the group are not closer to one end
or the other, and of course, you may choose any number in
between.
